"Add a section to your README.md describing the expected behavior for Likes and how well your app implements that behavior.

Add a section to your README.md describing how to use your deploy script.

This should include your README.md with the above sections and links to your Git repo and deployed app."

When you click on the show for a post as a logged in user, there will be a 'like' button, if you hadn't already liked the post. If you click the button, your email will be added to a list of users who had liked the post. If you click unlike, you will unlike the post and your name will be removed. My app follows this expected behavior.

My deploy script is run just by putting 'bash deploy.sh' into the command line.
