"Add a section to your project README.md describing the expected behavior of your login, post, and follow features and describing how well your app implements that behavior."

When you type in an email that is a user in the system into the text box and then click login, it will log you in as a user. The text box to type in will disappear and your username will popup instead. You can log out following that initial login by clicking the same button.

If you click post at the top index which says either posts or users, you will see a link at the bottom of the page that says "new post" which will allow a user to add a post to the database and it will be linked to their user id. If one is not logged in at the time, there will be no user id in the database for the post.

If you click on "show" for an individual user, you will see a follow button underneath their information that will add the follow of you as a logged in user to that other user's id to the database.
